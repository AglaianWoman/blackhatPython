# blackhatPython
A set of network tools for your hacking delight. 

These tools are created with the help of "Blackhat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters". 

Often when you're connected to a server, you don't necessarily have the right tools at hand. Experienced system administrators often removes packages like `netcat` - and you can forget all about `Wireshark`. Luckily we often find the `Python` package to be installed on such servers, though, and that's where these tools come in handy - a replacement for typical needed network tools.
